## FAQs

**What does the rocket ship icon in my status bar mean?**

In the status bar of your editor/IDE, we show a rocket ship icon when your time code today exceeds your daily code time's 90-day average

**Does keeping VSCode open affect time tracking/metrics?**

The answer is "No", keeping the editor open should not skew your metrics. You do not need to close VS Code to ensure that Code Time metrics are correct.

The timer starts when you start typing. It stops after 15 minutes without typing or opening/closing files in the editor. We then truncate the last 15 minutes of inactivity from the data.
